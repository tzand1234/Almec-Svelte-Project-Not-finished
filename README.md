# Almec project

I developed a Svelte application for Almec, which was deployed and actively used in production for a period of time. This project provided invaluable hands-on experience with the Svelte framework and its ecosystem, allowing me to gain a deep understanding of its features, performance optimizations, and best practices in building efficient and responsive web applications.
